The rep consists of my experiments with SCM/NVM programming libraries namely,
					NVThreads [1]
					NVML	  [2]
					Mnemosyne [3]
Using above libraries following concurrent persistent DS has been implemented:
					coarse grained persistent Set.
					fine grained persistent Set.

The implementation of above two algorithms follows Art of Multicore programming by Maurice Herlihy.
To build and see the Set implementation working please follow instructions within each subdirectory.
